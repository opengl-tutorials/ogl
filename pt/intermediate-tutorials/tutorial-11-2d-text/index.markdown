In this tutorial, we'll learn to draw 2D text on top of our 3D content. In our case, this will be a simple timer :

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuto-11-2d-text/clock.png)


# The API

We're going to implement this simple interface (in common/text2D.h):

``` cpp
void initText2D(const char * texturePath);
void printText2D(const char * text, int x, int y, int size);
void cleanupText2D();
```

In order for the code to work at both 640*480 and 1080p, x and y will be coordinates in [0-800][0-600]. The vertex shader will adapt this to the actual size of the screen.

See common/text2D.cpp for the complete implementation.

# The texture

initText2D simply reads a texture and a couple of shaders. There's nothing fancy about it, but let's look at the texture :

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuto-11-2d-text/fontalpha.png)


This texture was generated using [CBFG](http://www.codehead.co.uk/cbfg/), one of the many tools that generate textures from fonts. It was then imported in Paint.NET where I added a red background (for visualisation purposes only : everywhere you see red, it's supposed to be transparent ).

The goal of printText2D will thus be to generate quads with the appropriate screen position and texture coordinates.

# Drawing

We have to fill these buffers :

``` cpp
std::vector<glm::vec2> vertices;
std::vector<glm::vec2> UVs;
```

For each character, we compute the coordinates of the four vertices that will define the quad, and add the two triangles :

``` cpp
for ( unsigned int i=0 ; i<length ; i++ ){

    glm::vec2 vertex_up_left    = glm::vec2( x+i*size     , y+size );
    glm::vec2 vertex_up_right   = glm::vec2( x+i*size+size, y+size );
    glm::vec2 vertex_down_right = glm::vec2( x+i*size+size, y      );
    glm::vec2 vertex_down_left  = glm::vec2( x+i*size     , y      );

    vertices.push_back(vertex_up_left   );
    vertices.push_back(vertex_down_left );
    vertices.push_back(vertex_up_right  );

    vertices.push_back(vertex_down_right);
    vertices.push_back(vertex_up_right);
    vertices.push_back(vertex_down_left);
```

Now for the UVs. The upper-left coordinate is computed as follows :

``` cpp
    char character = text[i];
    float uv_x = (character%16)/16.0f;
    float uv_y = (character/16)/16.0f;
```

This works ( sort of - see below ) because the [ASCII code for A](http://www.asciitable.com/) is 65.

65%16 = 1, so A is on column #1 (starts at 0 !).

65/16 = 4, so A is on line #4 ( it's integer division, so it's not 4.0625 as it should be)

Both are divided by 16.0 to fit in the [0.0 - 1.0] range needed by OpenGL textures.

And now we just have to do the very same thing than we did, but for the vertices :

``` cpp
    glm::vec2 uv_up_left    = glm::vec2( uv_x           , 1.0f - uv_y );
    glm::vec2 uv_up_right   = glm::vec2( uv_x+1.0f/16.0f, 1.0f - uv_y );
    glm::vec2 uv_down_right = glm::vec2( uv_x+1.0f/16.0f, 1.0f - (uv_y + 1.0f/16.0f) );
    glm::vec2 uv_down_left  = glm::vec2( uv_x           , 1.0f - (uv_y + 1.0f/16.0f) );

    UVs.push_back(uv_up_left   );
    UVs.push_back(uv_down_left );
    UVs.push_back(uv_up_right  );

    UVs.push_back(uv_down_right);
    UVs.push_back(uv_up_right);
    UVs.push_back(uv_down_left);
 }
```

The rest is just as usual : bind the buffers, fill them, select the shader program, bind the texture, enable/bind/configure the vertex attributes, enable the blending, and call glDrawArrays. Hooray ! You're done.

Note a very important thing : the coordinates are generated in the [0,800][0,600] range. In other words, there is NO NEED for a matrix here. The vertex shader simply has to put it in the [-1,1][-1,1] range with very simple math (this could be done in C++ too) :

``` glsl
void main(){

    // Output position of the vertex, in clip space
    // map [0..800][0..600] to [-1..1][-1..1]
    vec2 vertexPosition_homoneneousspace = vertexPosition_screenspace - vec2(400,300); // [0..800][0..600] -> [-400..400][-300..300]
    vertexPosition_homoneneousspace /= vec2(400,300);
    gl_Position =  vec4(vertexPosition_homoneneousspace,0,1);

    // UV of the vertex. No special space for this one.
    UV = vertexUV;
}
```
{: .highlightglslvs }

The fragment shader does very little too :

``` glsl
void main(){
    color = texture( myTextureSampler, UV );
}
```
{: .highlightglslfs }

By the way, don't use this code for production, since it only handles the Latin alphabet. Or don't sell anything to India, China, Japan ( or even Germany, since there is no &szlig; on this image ). This texture will mostly work in France (notice the &eacute;, &agrave;, &ccedil;, etc) because it's been generated with my locale. And beware while adapting code from other tutorials of when using libraries, most of them use OpenGL 2, which isn't compatible. Unfortunately I don't know any good-enough library which handles UTF-8.

By the way, you should read [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html) by Joel Spolsky.
