Do you want to translate just one page ? No problem !
A whole series of tutorial ? Even better (^_^)!

# Want to complete / correct an existing translation ?

Clone the branch "gh-pages" on the project's github repository [here](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/gh-pages).
Find the page you want to edit, modify it, and simply send it back to us **by email** (or submit a **github pull request if you prefer**).

>Finding the file you want to edit is really easy.
>For example if you want to translate that page in japanese:
>
>[https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/gh-pages/jp/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-9-vbo-indexing](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/gh-pages/jp/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-9-vbo-indexing)
>
>Notice the path of the page: *"jp/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-9-vbo-indexing/"*.
>Next in the github repository, under the branch *gh-pages*, you'll find a file: *"index.markdown"* under the same path:
>
>[https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/gh-pages/jp/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-9-vbo-indexing](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/gh-pages/jp/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-9-vbo-indexing)

# Want to participate in a new language ?

Contact us, we will create the new language folder for you, and you can then follow the same step as above: Find the file you want to translate, edit it, and send it back via email or pull-request.
