<p>A new, much requested article is available here :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/miscellaneous/building-your-own-c-application/">http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/miscellaneous/building-your-own-c-application/</a></p>
<p>The tutorial's code use CMake (and a lot of work) to hide the complexity of linking the dependencies, compiling the code, and so on. This makes the entry barrier low, but also makes it complicated to create your own project from scratch. A playground was introduced to mitigate the issue, but this isn't enough.</p>
<p>So this tutorial explains the very basics of C and C++ compilation - just enough to get you up and running, and how to do basic actions usin popular IDEs.</p>
<p>It also features a Troobleshooting section in case you have any problem.</p>
